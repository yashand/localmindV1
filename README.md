## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1. **Flutter SDK** (3.0.0 or later)
2. **Ollama** installed on your laptop
3. **Llama 3 model** downloaded via Ollama
4. **Android Studio** or **Xcode** for mobile development

### Setup Instructions

#### 1. Clone and Setup Flutter App

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yashand/localmindV1.git
cd localmindV1
flutter pub get
```

#### 2. Configure Ollama Server

Install Ollama on your laptop:
```bash
# Install Ollama (macOS/Linux)
curl -fsSL https://ollama.ai/install.sh | sh

# Pull Llama 3 model
ollama pull llama3

# Start Ollama server
ollama serve
```

Ollama will be available at `http://localhost:11434`

#### 3. Configure Tailscale (Optional)

For cross-device connectivity:
```bash
# Install Tailscale on your laptop
# Visit https://tailscale.com/download

# Get your Tailscale IP
tailscale ip -4
```

Use this IP in the app settings instead of localhost.

#### 4. Build and Run

```bash
# Android
flutter run -d android

# iOS
flutter run -d ios
```

### First Launch Configuration

1. **Open LocalMind app**
2. **Go to Settings tab**
3. **Configure Ollama URL**:
   - Local: `http://localhost:11434`
   - Tailscale: `http://[your-tailscale-ip]:11434`
4. **Test Connection** - should show "Connected to Ollama"
5. **Grant Permissions** as needed for desired features

## üìñ Usage Guide

### Basic Chat
- Type messages or use voice input button
- Toggle between Work/Personal modes
- Voice commands automatically detected and executed

### Voice Commands
- **App Control**: "Open Spotify", "Open Gmail"
- **System Control**: "Turn on WiFi", "Enable Bluetooth"
- **Multi-step**: "Open Spotify and turn on WiFi"

### Mode Switching
